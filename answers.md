# Dlang Community Survey

The idea was to find out which parts of the language are should be improved, in which areas are working members of community and are they finding D suitable for their day-to-day work.

12 persons answered the questions.

3 of them stop using D :( They mostly find D immature and too risky to use in production. However we all knew Symmetry and Funkwerk experience is quite good.

Also problems with bugs in the language and the absent of the libraries were mentioned as one of the reasons of why users abandoned D.

But there are plenty of users that like to use D.

The strongest parts of D are related to ease of use, good performance and one the best meta-programming experience.

D community looks pretty welcome. Some of the users even participate in the language development.

Survey asked about some famous tools and approaches. Most of the users like Dub (but it is known that some part of the community prefers Makefiles and Meson)

Most of the users prefer to write in Visual Studio Code.

Areas of usage D covers all proposed cases and it is really hard to find any clear winner here.

The Linux obviously is the main target - there was no surprise.

Most of the participants of the survey regularly use: templates, threading, nogc, mixins. A little bit rarely: safe and trusted.

Ideas about improvement are mostly concentrated on fixing compiler bugs and improve tooling.

The features, tools, or libraries participants would like to have in D:

- backwards compatibility, REPL
- alias this operator overloading interfaces
- smart pointers in std, less GC in std
- improved eventloop, more robust communication libs (snmp, grpc, protobuf, etc), telemetry logging tools
- move semantics, cast operators overloading.

This survey is based on the questions from Nim lang survey. The link was shared in the one of the D telegram chat.

I want to thank all participants and all (current and previous) users of the D language.
